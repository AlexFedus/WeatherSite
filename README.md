# WeatherSite
     This is a simple weather site that can show  
     a few different  weather statistics for a specific city. 
# Introduction
     The idea to create this project can be credited to a youtube  
     video that I watched. I saw a video tutorial of a weather  
     app built with html, css, and javascript. I decided to take  
     the idea and create my own project. Therefore, every  
     single feature of this project is not an original idea  
     from myself. 

# Features
     This weather site allows the user to enter a city name, or  
     click a button to allow the browser to get the user's  
     current  location. From there the site shows various  
     information  including the current temperature, a  
     description of the  current weather with a symbol, the  
     humidity percentage, and  the wind speed. There is also  
     a button that appears on the  bottom of the weather  
     information that is labeled "3 Day  Forecast" When  
     this button is clicked, the site will display  the  
     same information that was mentioned above for the  
     next 3  days.

# Tools Used
    To obtain the weather information, I used the api from 
    www.openweathermap.org

# How to View
    This site is available to use at https://alexfedus.github.io/WeatherSite/
